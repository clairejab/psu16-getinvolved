## Part 1: Join a PSU Club

This year I decided to join the Student Red Cross Club. In High School, I was very involved in my school’s Red Cross Club. I volunteered at blood drives and went around school a week in advance to get people to sign up to donate blood. Coming to college I knew I wanted to be apart of a volunteer club and since I loved the Red Cross Club in High School, I thought I would enjoy it in college too! At the first meeting, we learned exactly what the Student Red Cross Club does. The Student Red Cross Club runs all blood drives throughout the entire year on Penn State’s campus. Besides blood drives, the Student Red Cross Club also does outreach programs like Jared’s box and Totes of Hope to help people in the community. We also did an icebreaker where we got to meet others in the club. I really enjoyed the meeting and felt inspired to be a part of such a big volunteer club. I am still a member of the Student Red Cross Club and shortly after joining I applied and got the position as THON Captain. I was in charge of coming up with fundraisers to raise money for our Club’s Organization. In November, I was told to apply for an executive board position by past exec board members. So now I am the Treasurers of the Student Red Cross Club.  I am in charge of dealing with all the money and organizing the blood drives. I am so excited for this new role and what is in store for the club. It was one of the best decisions I made to join the Student Red Cross Club and I am so glad I did it!

## Part 2: Try New Things at PSU
In the beginning of the semester, I went on a hike with a girl group called CHAARG. CHAARG is a women's health and fitness group that inspires girls to exercise! One of CHAARG's first activites was to take a hike up Mount Nittany. It was a 45 minute hike that was very steep but there was an incredible view from on top. I really enjoyed meeting new people and seeing all of PSU from above! I actually decided not to join CHAARG because I was involved in three other clubs and I didn't want to spread myself too thin in the first semester. I really did enjoy the people and the atmosphere of the group so I may consider joining next semester! Below is a picture with me and some of the people I met on the hike up Mount Nittany.

This semester I was fortunate enough to have gotten PSU Football Student Season ticekts! Coming to PSU, I knew I really wanted to attend all the football games. I love the school unity atmosphere at the games where everyone is cheering for PSU! I am so glad I attended all of the home football games for the 2018 season. I really enjoyed meeting new people and feeling the team spirit. I plan on getting PSU Football Student Season tickets next year as well! Below is a picture of me and my friend Elli at a football game.

One of the best decisions I have made this year is deciding to join a THON committee. I am so fortunate enough to have been selected to be on Myles Boerlin's Dancer Relations THON committee. Dancer Relations is the committee in charge of watching over the dancer's THON weekend as they stand for 46 hours straight! I will be assigned to one dancer and I will take care of his/her needs for all of THON weekend. I love my THON comittee with all of my heart. They inspire me everyday and have made my experience so great here at PSU! Below is a picture from when we all first met at Yellow Shirt Orientation.

I have been a competitive swimmer since I was 5 years old. Coming to college I did not want to stop swimming! I decided to join the PSU Club Swim Team. We practice every night except Friday and Saturday and practices are not mandatory. I have met so many great people on the team who I enjoy hanging out with! With Club Swimming we are fortunte enough to be able to travel as a team and attend other swim meets. This picture was taken at the Blue vs White meet at PSU in October. The Blue vs White meet was just PSU Club Swim split up into two different teams swimming against each other. I am so excited because at this meet I qualified for 3 events for Nationals which will be held at Ohio State during spring semester!
